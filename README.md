# Marxist-Reguardist


# Name Origin:    
Marxist-Reguardist are the most well reguarded communists in the world.  We are the true communists.  All before have been failed attempts. We use the term "Reguarded" to refer to fellow comrades that are upholding our values.  

For example. "Wow your so reguarded!!",  "Only a complete reguard would support that!"


# Laws of the Marxist-Reguardist:

1. Only support Social issues. We cannot fix economic problems until we fix the problems in society.  They are a distraction from Social Justice.
2. Focus on supporting the 20% side of 80/20 issues.  Siding with the majority is what fascist do. The majority is fascist.
3. We are never CIS-Gender. The Nazi's were Cis gender.
4. We never control our emotions. The only way to make social progress is to be as emotional and uncontrolled as possible. Being Neurotic is a virtue.
5. Winning is not as important is being virtuous. Winning is what Capitalists focus on. It is a sin to the reguarded.
6. America Last, We are the richest most powerful country in the world. We must always put foreigners first.
7. Constant Purity Tests, Never support another communist or democrat that does not agree with you 100%. Working together for a common goal is fascism.
